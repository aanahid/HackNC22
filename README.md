HackNC 2022 project (November 4-6, 2022). Made by Alondra Alfaro Bonilla, Heather Eng, Christine Hu, Joseph Pham.

College Clicker is a clicker game that allows the user to eat, sleep, socialize and study. Each action will affect one of the three meters which measure happiness 😃, school 🏫, and energy🔋. This program is a fun game for the user to try to maintain a good school-life balance while in college.

The player has the option to click on buttons along the bottom of the screen and one of the side of the screen that are associated with activities. Each activity will increase their related level, but beware! They may also decrease other levels in the process.

Can you survive college? Try it and find out!
